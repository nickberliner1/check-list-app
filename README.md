# check-list-app

I was given this app already written, but with some bugs and performance issues. I'm going through and fixing it all, adding tests with Jasmine, 
and documenting my process as well as how the app works along the way (so future developers don't run into my same problems).

I also compared it to a competitor's app, so you can see how much better mine is.
